# CSC446-Image-Processing-using-Sockets
A program that simulated a service over a cloud using sockets to transmit and process images.

In order to run this program, open it in any Java IDE (I used Eclipse) and run the TServer class first. The console will output the server has started.
Then you can run both TClient and TClient2 however many times you like, the server supports as many clients as you want.
You're also free to change the images or change the file paths for the images.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**
  - This project uses the Build Path / Systems Library JavaSE - 1.8 (jre)
  - Images larger than around 256x256 may not load, this is feature not implemented in this version.
      > Some time in the future I should upload an "Enchanced" version of this project that has more features, such as support for any image size

Enjoy :)
